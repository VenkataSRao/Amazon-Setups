Background:
===========
Required to install cassandra in aws.
Need to install below components
Cassandra-2.1.8
opscenter-5.2.0
datastax-agent
 
What we did:
============
Initially took t2.micro instance and downloaded cassandra2.1.8 and updated cassandra.yaml file in conf directory and when trying to start
cassandra services
 
below observations we found
 
Connection error: ('Unable to connect to any servers', {'127.0.0.1': error(111, "Tried connecting to [('127.0.0.1', 9042)]. Last error:
Connection refused")})
 
and it is not starting services and also process has been killed automatically..
 
after couple of times trying to update yaml file and tried doing all other stuff changing yaml file with different options.. but still no
luck.. still having issues to start server...
 
Solution:
=========
t2.micro instances are not sufficient to handle cassandra.. so we have taken m2.medium instance and downloaded cassandra2.1.8software and updated
yaml file and started services..
 
used below commands to start services:
 
Cassandra &
opscenter &
datastax-agent &
 
( above commands will work only when set the proper path )
 
everything is working fine here...
 
again we faced some other issue here with opsceter..
 
while adding cluster to datastax opscenter ( localhot:8888) and trying to add clustr with Manage existing Cluster option.. getting below exception
Error creating cluster: Unexpected token <
 
tried all the options.. Struck with this unexpected token issue...
 
watch this space for update.. :-)
