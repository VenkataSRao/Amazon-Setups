Cassandra database is the right choice when you need scalability and high availability without compromising performance. 

Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for 
mission-critical data. 

Cassandra's support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and the 
peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.

Cassandra's data model offers the convenience of column indexes with the performance of log-structured updates, strong support 
for denormalization and materialized views, and powerful built-in caching.
