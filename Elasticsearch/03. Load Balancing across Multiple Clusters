If you have multiple nodes in your Elasticsearch cluster, the easiest way to distribute Kibana requests across the nodes 
is to run an Elasticsearch client node on the same machine as Kibana. Elasticsearch client nodes are essentially smart 
load balancers that are part of the cluster. They process incoming HTTP requests, redirect operations to the other nodes 
in the cluster as needed, and gather and return the results. For more information, see Node in the Elasticsearch 
reference.
